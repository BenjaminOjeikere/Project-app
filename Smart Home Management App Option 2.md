Step 1: Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) or SQS (Simple Queue Service)
Register Your Devices
Use Amazon SNS or SQS for managing device communication through a pub/sub or message queuing model.
Setup Device Communication
Devices communicate by sending messages to SNS topics or SQS queues. SNS can send real-time alerts, while SQS manages queues for processing tasks asynchronously.
Security Policies
Define IAM roles and policies to control which devices or components can publish or subscribe to SNS topics or process SQS queues.

Step 2: Amazon Aurora
Create a Relational Database
Use Amazon Aurora as an alternative to DynamoDB if you prefer a relational database with MySQL or PostgreSQL compatibility.
Database Design
Table Name: UserSettings
Primary Key: UserID
Columns: DeviceID, DeviceState, Preferences, etc.
CRUD Operations
Perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations using standard SQL queries, or leverage Amazon RDS Data API for Aurora Serverless to interact with the database without a persistent connection.

Step 3: AWS Lambda (Unchanged)
Create Lambda Functions
Continue to use AWS Lambda for handling backend logic:
Function to update device states when the user changes settings.
Function to execute automated routines based on user behavior and schedules.

Step 4: Amazon API Gateway (Alternative to AppSync)
Create RESTful or WebSocket APIs
Use Amazon API Gateway to create RESTful APIs or WebSocket APIs for real-time communication between the user interface and backend services.
Define Endpoints
Define REST or WebSocket endpoints for user and device data.
Connect API to Lambda
Link API Gateway endpoints to Lambda functions to retrieve and modify data, similar to how AppSync resolvers operate.

Step 5: User Authentication with AWS Cognito (Unchanged)
Use Amazon Cognito
Use Amazon Cognito for user authentication and account management, ensuring secure access to the app.
Set up user pools to handle sign-up/sign-in flows, user roles, and multi-factor authentication.
