##### AWS setup

Step 1: AWS IoT Core
Register Your Devices: Create IoT Things for each smart device (lights, thermostat, security cameras).
Setup Device Communication: Use MQTT or HTTP to enable communication between devices and the AWS IoT Core.
Security Policies: Define security policies to control which devices can publish or subscribe to specific topics.


Step 2: Amazon DynamoDB
Create a DynamoDB Table: Design a table to store user settings, device states, and preferences. For example:
Table Name: UserSettings
Primary Key: UserID
Attributes: DeviceID, DeviceState, Preferences, etc.
CRUD Operations: Use AWS SDK (e.g., AWS Amplify) in your app to perform create, read, update, and delete operations on this table.

Step 3: AWS Lambda
Create Lambda Functions: Implement functions to handle events triggered by AWS IoT Core or AppSync. For example:
Function to Update Device State: Triggered when a user changes a device setting.
Function for Automated Routines: Executes predefined routines based on user behavior.

Step 4: AWS AppSync
Create GraphQL API: Set up an AppSync API to enable real-time communication between the frontend and backend.
Define Schema: Create a GraphQL schema for user and device data.
Connect Resolvers: Link resolvers to DynamoDB and Lambda functions to fetch and modify data.

Step 5: User Authentication
AWS Cognito: Use Amazon Cognito for user authentication and management. Set up user pools to manage user accounts and handle sign-up/sign-in flows.
